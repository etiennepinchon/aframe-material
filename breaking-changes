hey man,

     It seems that Aframe-material doesn't work past aframe 0.6.1. I have a cloned copy, on my website, and it works wonderfully at aframe 0.6.1.
     but i have not been able to get it to work with aframe 0.7.x., aframe 0.8.x., nor aframe 0.9.2.
     I figure that something Aframe-material used was changed in the newer version of aframe, and now it no longer functions.
     i compared changes made, with a tool here on Github, but i couldn't nail down what the problem is
     Maybe I am wrong, maybe it works and I missing something simple? I dont know.
     but that's why I have reached out to you; Hoping you can shed some light on this, or point me in the right direction?
     
     I appreciate the nice work on Aframe-material. Just what I needed to improve my scene substantially. 
     also, the google resonance thing is cool, too.
